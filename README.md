## A funny story
When I was a kid, my friend and I were at recess. I tried to imitate an English accent I had seen on TV. Then, I drink my Cecemel© quietly and there, you have my friend who says "I smoke a cigarette" with an English accent spot on. I spit all my Cecemel© on the window of the classroom. The teachers arrive, see me, yell at me and I have to copy 100x "Smoking is not funny". French imitating english accent cracks me up everytime ever since.
#### I have conditioned myself to never smoke while spitting cocoa against a window.
